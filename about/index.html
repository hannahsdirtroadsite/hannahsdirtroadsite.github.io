            I did not set out to become a rural land specialist… I realized that I <i>am</i> a Rural Land Specialist,
            and
            then I
            <i>became</i> a Realtor and, eventually, a Broker! I already understand the costs and hurdles of changing a
            rural piece
            of land into a homestead, a farm or an escape property, and I love it! I think everyone should live like I
            do,
            so I'm the
            right person to talk to about rural property adventures.
            <br><br>
            I prefer to work East of Kingman, West of Ashfork, and North of Wikieup, but for some, I'll go to the
            fringes
            of
            the DRRE preferred areas.
            <br><br>
            When someone tells you that "it can't be done" (in regards to rural properties or financing for off-grid) I
            am
            who you should be talking to: I can get-'er-dun!

            I'm Elise's husband, usually behind the scenes and available for everything Dirt Road Real Estate
            related. I'm a Butcher, a Baker and a Candlestick maker: I've been a Developer, General Contractor, Master
            Electrician, and head of my own construction and development
            company. I bring a lot to the party!
            <br><br>
            I've been in the building and real estate industry for over
            35 years. I started on the East coast doing Real Estate in New Jersey, bounced to the Pacific island of
            American Samoa, lept into Las Vegas
            and finally ended up in beautiful Mohave County Arizona. I live outside of Kingman with the love of my life
            and stay busy with the tasks of rural living every day. I look forward to helping people make good choices
            and understand the full reality of rural living. It's not as easy as the brochure makes it look!

            Our paths in life continually change yet our values do not. When my husband and I moved here to NW AZ in
            2017 from the Midwest (NW IN), a new path opened up where I can enjoy incredible sunrises and sunsets, the
            open range, wild burros and 360 mountains views. This new path, becoming part of the Dirt Road Real Estate
            family, allowed me to share that enjoyment with others who wish to live here in one of the last vestiges of
            the Old Wild West.
            <br><br>
            Plain and simple, I love selling dirt here in Golden Valley along with to the north and west of Kingman
            including White Hills and Yucca.
            <br><br>
            What I do know from my 5 decades of professional corporate sales experience people buy from people they know
            and trust. Finding someone who truly appreciates the ins and outs of rural living; actually drives to the
            vacant land parcels; understands financing, road and utilities access along with county requirements; and
            “protects and promote you” as a client is essential when considering hiring an agent. I look forward to
            hearing from and working with you.

            I've lived in many communities, both rural and urban, and different states. In 2013, we bought 45 acres in
            the rural mountains of Mohave County to hike, shoot, and camp on with our kids—truly one of the definitions
            of 'quiet enjoyment' of our property (okay, mostly quiet…). That property started a love affair with a new
            countryside, county, and lifestyle, and a place for us to put down roots, and now Kingman is home.
            <br><br>
            I became a realtor in 2019 and have handled more than 100 transactions to date. I love to help other people
            find their quiet enjoyment—whatever that is for them. My recent experience of working with a fantastic
            contractor to build a stick-built house off 4 miles of dirt road and ending up with a beautiful home that
            has utility company power, septic, and a well has taught me more about that process than any book ever
            could. I'm a problem-solver at heart, and matching up a client with their 'right' property is a wonderful
            'problem' to solve.
            <br><br>
            My areas of expertise include east of Kingman, west of Ash Fork, north of Wikieup, and of course Kingman
            itself, but I've gone almost everywhere in the county as my clients really hone in on what fits their needs.
            Our little piece of Heaven in northwest Arizona just has so much to offer!

            Fred joined Dirt Road Real Estate because he saw his wife, Janay, having all the fun. Fred's previous work
            experience
            was scheduling multiple people's work efforts and working as the troubleshooter for those events. This made
            him <i>very</i> well qualified for
            the reality of a Realtor's work efforts!
            <br><br>
            Fred recently gained another qualification: he is a licensed Home Inspector. He's available to any of the
            Dirt Road Agents, but his closeness to our company and agents must be acknowledged and accepted, and he's
            scrupulous about avoiding conflict of interest. Fred tends to do mostly
            land
            transactions as a realtor for this reason. Fred is available for the Western part of Mohave County,
            Mohave

            I have always been a lover of Real Estate. In 2020 my husband and I had the opportunity to
            follow our dream and purchase land of our own. We searched for years before falling in love with our
            property here in Kingman. In 2021 we sold our home in Northern California, moved our family, and never
            looked back! We developed our off-grid homestead from raw land, in which I gained a wealth of
            knowledge and experience to help others along their journey; I can tell you about everything that you don't
            know about, from setting up fences and storage building to setting up a mailbox.
            <br><br>
            The years of searching, and the process of bringing our dream to life pushed me toward a new
            career as a Realtor. My hope is to help you find your perfect paradise whether it be a home, land, or
            anything else in between!

            Born and raised in Southern California, I have always embraced the vibrant energy and diverse culture of my
            surroundings. I am fluent in Spanish, which has enriched my personal and professional interactions.
            <br><br>
            My
            journey brought me to Arizona, where the river and the rugged landscape serve as a constant source of
            inspiration. I am passionate about living off-grid and living close to nature, which fuels my love for
            racing and outdoor adventures. There's something profoundly fulfilling about working with people who share
            my enthusiasm for the outdoors and sustainable living.

            I've been in Real Estate for some time now. My favorite part is helping first time home buyers find the
            perfect place for them. Your home is likely to be the largest single investment you make in your lifetime,
            and I'm happy to help walk you through a process that can seem intimidating without experienced help.
            <br><br>
            I'm trained in probate sales and am happy to be a resource to guide you through them. I also have a great
            deal of experience with the purchase of manufactured homes on rented land, such as trailer parks or
            townhomes.
            Reach out to me for anything in Northern Mohave County, Residential or Land. Real Estate transactions can be
            complex, so I'm here to help guide you through the intricacies of the process.
