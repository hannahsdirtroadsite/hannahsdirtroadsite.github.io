        One of our specialties here at Dirt Road Real Estate is finding the right rural community for you! These are
        some of the communities we've developed ties with in the Kingman/Hackberry Area. Some of these ranches have have
        now been developed into mini-ranches for country living. Click on the drop down to learn more about each
        community!

        <br><br>

        These communities offer a wide range of elevation, terrain, and vegetation. Some, like Windmill Ranches and
        Cedar Hills, are high desert slopes with endless views. Willow Creek Ranch and others offer a beautiful
        pinyon-juniper habitat with rolling foothills and sweeping canyons. A few communities even overlook high
        mountain vistas at an altitude of over 6,000 feet. Many of these communities also offer water tables at a depth
        that makes drilling a well viable, unlike many locations further east.

        <br><br>

        Despite their differences, these communities share many similarities that make them attractive to many. They
        offer properties that are private, quiet, and peaceful, where the only sound is the wind through the trees or
        grasses. The properties are versatile, and can be lived on sustainably. The climate is mild year round, with
        minimal heat in the summer and minimal cold in the winter. Some properties are inexpensive, allowing owners to
        live on a fixed cost when paid off. Finally, many of these properties offer views that cannot be beat.

          <h1 class="section_header pad_left">History</h1>
          <p class="community_desc">
            Willow Creek Ranch is a unique, water rich area in Northern Arizona. The community has been a part of a
            large working cattle ranch for many years. The 24,000-acre ranch was split up into about 320 36-acre parcels
            in 1997. An adjacent 15,000 plus acres was added to the ranch allotment making the Willow Creek cattle ranch
            area approximately 40,000 acres of working cattle ranch. There are more than 7 springs on the allotment,
            though mostare reserved for the ranchers water use. The Willow Creek ranch area is mentioned in many books
            written
            about the settling of the Arizona territories. Sometimes it is referred to as the Willows Ranch.
          </p>
          <h1 class="section_header pad_left">Location</h1>
          <p class="community_desc">
            Willow Creek Ranch lies halfway between Kingman and Seligman Arizona (35 miles from each) north and south of
            Interstate 40 at 5,000 to about 5,800 feet elevation. The elevation creates an ideal, mild year-round
            climate, cooler than Kingman and the deserts to the west and south and warmer than snowy Flagstaff at nearly
            7,000 feet to the east. Elevation is one of the secrets that makes Willow Creek Ranch a great place to live
            — retire, homestead, be self-sufficient, vacation, hunt, ride horses or ATV's for all or part of the year!

          <h1 class="section_header pad_left">Features</h1>
          <p class="community_desc">
            The parcel size, the rugged topography, and the fact that the area is heavily treed with juniper, pinon pine
            and scrub oak add to the feeling of seclusion. The land is hilly and rough with streams and canyons and
            incredible hilltop vistas; perfect for exploring on foot, ATV or by horseback.

            Homes at Willow Creek Ranch are varied, from mobiles and modular to custom site-built homes. There is even a
            straw-bale home on the ranch. The fertile soil provides great gardens and wildlife abounds. Solar systems
            are now very affordable for these homes where there is no grid-tied power available. A few properties nearer
            to the freeway have grid power but most properties are off grid. Water is typically found from at a drilling
            depth of 350 to 550 feet in this area.

            Windmill Ranches is still a working cattle ranch, previously known as the Fancher ranch when the travel from
            Phoenix to Kingman was done by horse or stage coach. The community is located approximately 30 miles east of
            Kingman. It is told that in the 1800's this area was a picnic spot for people travelling between Kingman and
            Phoenix. At 3,000 to 4,500 feet elevation, the hills slope upward to the east with grasses, palo christi
            trees and high-desert cactus and shrubs giving way to juniper and pinion on the higher east slopes. The POA

            Windmill is a rare ranch community which allows commercial development in the parcels fronting Highway 93.
            Horses and cattle are allowed in “reasonable number” but no pigs. Water has been found by most property
            owners who have drilled for it. Some parcels here can be divided but the minimum size is 5 acres. Properties
            closest to Hwy 93 can connect to the utility provided power grid, others are off grid with generators or
            solar. Views here are long and open with mountains to the east and south. Deer, Elk and Javelina abound with
            occasional sightings of Mountain Lion or Bobcats.

            building, and the railroad. The original site of the town of Hackberry exists on Spring Valley Ranches. When
            the railroad came in along Route 66 the town decided they were missing out and they relocated close to the
            railroad tracks. The seven stone buildings and the hand dug well can still be found with permission from the
            current owner.

            When I-40 bypassed the town of Hackberry in the mid 20's the town and most of the gas stations

          <p class="community_desc">
            Sierra Verde is the largest of the organized subdivided ranches. There are a few well maintained roads
            and there are roads within SVR that look like they haven't seen a maintenance vehicle in years. This could
            be just because of the huge number of miles of roadway to keep up on. There is a website and a handful of
            Facebook pages to learn about Sierra Verde Ranches, but being so large you may want to just focus in your
            small ten square mile area of concern. Stop and talk to the locals in your immediate area of interest; they
            will tell you stories! Remember some of it will be stories, having only a small element of fact to
            it. There is no guaranteed “free” water in SVR, but currently it does seem that you are allowed a certain
            amount “free,” there doesn't seem to be anything within their governing documents that assures that practice
            will continue.
            More information about the POA can be found here:

            Sierra Verde Ranches are a mix of 4,700' in elevation up to 6,000', some is flat and grass land like, others
            is steep, clay or rocky; in SVR there is certainly something for everyone. SVR is still a working cattle
            ranch, so fence out if you don't welcome the cattle in your yard, on your deck or in your haybarn! Sierra
            Verde Ranch is generally located south of Seligman and west of Seligman.

            Liberty land is not located within a POA or an HOA, and because of this, generally the roads accessing
            Liberty Land are non-maintained roads. Please drive with caution, and only in a four wheel drive vehicle!
            If
            possible, make sure you bring your realtor, since they know their way around.
            <br><br>
            These parcels are generally in out of the way places where
            developers didn't scoop up the large parcels and develop them into small micro communities. Although
            Liberty Land does not have additional CC&Rs and POA/HOA restrictions the properties will still be
            governed somewhat by County ordinances. There may be building restrictions/codes etc. that you need to
            be mindful of before you begin developing your property.

            Liberty Land has it positives and negatives: these are areas that you need to be a bit more concerned for
            legal access of your property. These are also areass that you will want to speak to the neighbors to see
            what kind of other things surround you. Remember some neighbors will definitely tell you the boogieman
            stories so that they scare you off: they may not want additional neighbors!
