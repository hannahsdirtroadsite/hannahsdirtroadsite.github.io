            I did not set out to become a rural land specialist… I realized that I <i>am</i> a Rural Land Specialist,
            and
            then I
            <i>became</i> a Realtor and, eventually, a Broker! I already understand the costs and hurdles of changing a
            rural piece
            of land into a homestead, a farm or an escape property, and I love it! I think everyone should live like I
            do,
            so I'm the
            right person to talk to about rural property adventures.
            <br><br>
            I prefer to work East of Kingman, West of Ashfork, and North of Wikieup, but for some, I'll go to the
            fringes
            of
            the DRRE preferred areas.

            I've lived in many communities, both rural and urban, and different states. When our kids were younger, we
            started looking for a place for our family to 'play' that wasn't so full of people as the congested parks
            and
            camping areas that were available to us. In 2013, we bought 45 acres in the rural mountains of Mohave County
            to hike, shoot, and camp on—truly one of the definitions of 'quiet enjoyment' of our property (okay, mostly
            quiet…). That property started a love affair with a new countryside, county, and lifestyle, and a place for
            us
            to put down roots, and now Kingman is home.
            <br><br>
            I became a realtor to help other people find their quiet enjoyment—whatever that is for them. I look forward
            to connecting people with what speaks to them, whether it's the right house, their dream piece of land, or a
            parcel that allows them to design their future. My recent experience of working with a fantastic contractor
            to
            build a stick-built house 40 miles outside of a city center off 4 miles of dirt road and ending up with a
            beautiful home that has utility company power, septic, and a well has taught me more about that process than
            any book ever could. I'm a problem-solver at heart, and matching up a client with their 'right' property is
            a
            wonderful 'problem' to solve.
            <br><br>
            My areas of expertise include east of Kingman, west of Seligman, north of Wikieup, and of course Kingman
            itself, but I've gone almost everywhere in the county as my clients really hone in on what fits their needs.
            Our little piece of Heaven in northwest Arizona just has so much to offer!

            My name is Janay Richardson. I was raised in Las Vegas, NV and and currently live in homes in both
            Henderson,
            NV and Golden Valley, AZ. I have a degree in Special Education / Elementary Education. I have 2 children
            and a
            husband of 9 years. I love the flexibility that real estate provides me so I can operate behind the scenes
            for
            all our agents and stay home with my kids at the same time. Real Estate has been a blessing to our family.
            <br><br>
            I am now an Associate Broker for Dirt Road Real Estate and I touch every piece of paper
            related to DRRE to make sure Elise is free to have conversations and interaction with all our clients and
            customers. I am the Broker Admin for all things DRRE and I can assist you with getting in touch with any
            of
            our agents. I am available to assist with anything DRRE in the event that Elise is busy.
            <br><br>
            I chose to be a realtor because I wanted a little something extra out of life and realty has always been
            very
            interesting to me. It is very fulfilling to be a part of someone's dream coming true. Never gets old.

            Fred joined Dirt Road Real Estate because he saw his wife having all the fun. Fred's previous work

            came

            <br><br>
            Fred recently added to his expertise as he became a licensed Home Inspector. Fred is available to any
            Dirt
            Road Agents, but the lack of arm's length must be acknowledged and accepted. Fred tends to do mostly
            land
            transactions as a realtor for this reason. Fred is available for the Western part of Mohave County,
            Mohave
            Valley, White Hills, Golden Valley, and Kingman.
