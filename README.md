A short little app to help me with grocery shopping. 
Essentially, you can upload your recipes to the app. It stores them in an RDS database.
You can then read the recipes anywhere, and if you forgot to make your shopping list, 
you can use the 'add to list' button to make a list out of the recipes you want to make that week.
